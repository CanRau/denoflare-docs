# Overview
Develop, test, and deploy [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) with [Deno](https://deno.land)

## Denoflare CLI
`denoflare` is a single cli tool to make developing and deploying Cloudflare Workers simple.

No need for [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯ ðŸ¤¯

Deno is a great fit for Workers development, the runtime is based on [the modern Web Platform](https://deno.land/manual@v1.14.3/runtime/web_platform_apis), just like Workers, is [secure by default](https://deno.land/manual@v1.14.3/getting_started/permissions), is based on [ESM modules](https://deno.land/manual@v1.14.3/linking_to_external_code), and has a [built-in bundler](https://deno.land/manual@v1.14.3/tools/bundler).

Denoflare can:
 - Give you first-class support for [ESM-based workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects#instantiating-and-communicating-with-a-durable-object)
 - Help you develop and test a worker, by running locally inside a permissionless Deno isolate, similar to the [Workers Runtime](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis)
   - see [denoflare serve](/cli/serve)
 - Deploy your JavaScript or TypeScript worker easily from a local script file, or from an https: URL
   - see [denoflare push](/cli/push)
 - Monitor your workers in production from the command line
   - see [denoflare tail](/cli/tail)
 - Generate a customizable static documentation site for Cloudflare Pages in the style of Cloudflare's [Docs Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs-engine/)
   - see [denoflare site](/cli/site)

## Deploy via files or URLs
Denoflare leverages Deno for bundling, so it works great for local files, but also URLs.  Deploying [a module-based hello worker](https://github.com/skymethod/denoflare/blob/v0.4.3/examples/hello-worker/hello.ts) is trivial:
```
denoflare push https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skymethod/denoflare/v0.4.3/examples/hello-worker/hello.ts
```

## Roadmap
Denoflare is still under active initial development (pre 1.0), but is completely open-source and can be used as is.

After getting this documentation site ([denoflare.dev](https://denoflare.dev)) hosted on Cloudflare Pages generated by `denoflare site`, the next focus is fleshing out unimplemented parts of the local dev Workers emulation environment, making it handle even the most complicated worker scenarios.

Join the project over on [the Denoflare GitHub repo](https://github.com/skymethod/denoflare).
